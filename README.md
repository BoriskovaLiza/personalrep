This is a rep with ALL code I ever wrote as a MIPT DAFE bachelor at MAP - Mathematics and applied informatics.
Each semester folder contains a file "program" with a list of all programming disciplines, followed by a brief contents description.
Titles of discipline folders are acronyms from their full names
